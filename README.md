# Readable Project from Udacity

## To get started:

* (From the `root` directory) Install all dependencies

cd frontend; npm i; cd ../api-server; npm i
```


* (Following the above, you should be in `*root/api-server`) Start the API server

__Note__: the server should be listening on port 3001 and frontend should be listening on 3000
