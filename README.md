# Readable Project from Udacity

This project represents a forum in which the user can read and make posts, post comments, and vote on pretty much everything. But not only is the user able to giveth, they can taketh as well by simply clicking the delete button.

## To get started:

* (From the `root` directory) Install all dependencies
```bash
cd frontend; npm i; cd ../api-server; npm i
```


* (Following the above, you should be in `*root/api-server`) Start the API server
```bash
node server
```

__Note__: the server should be listening on port 3001 and frontend should be listening on 3000

* In another terminal window, (From the `root` directory) start the frontend
```bash
cd frontend; npm start
```

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
